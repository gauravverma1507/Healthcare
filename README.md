Hey everyone we are all back with a project named : PREDICT WHETHER A PERSON IS DIABETIC OR NOT ... 

our objective is to predict whether a patient/person has diabetes on some medical parameters like :
-Pregnancies
-Glucose
-BloodPressure
-SkinThickness
-Insulin
-BMI
-DiabetesPedigree
-Age
-Outcome

our first step is to do some of the analysis of the data / understanding of the data
after cleaning the data , doing exploratory data analysis , and data scaling we move to the section of KNN

KNN ???
KNN is basically the the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric classification method which is often used for complex classifiers
it stands for k-nearest neighbors
used for both classifications and regressions

after the result analysis we get a model with average of 76.5% accuracy using knn

and yes you can also do the good practice of knn using this repository
